Lecture #7 - Memory Management - Main Memory 

Main Memory 
--
- programs must be loaded into main memory for execution 
- efficient memory allocation -> critical for multiprogramming 
- registers, main memory, and cache -> impact system performance 
        - registers access is done in one CPU block (or less)
        - main memory can take many cycles, causing stalls 
        - cache sits between main memory and cpu registers (L0/L1 caches)

Memory Management Requirements 
--
Relocation : processes must move in memory without restrictions 
    - active processes need to be swapped in and out of main memory in order to maximize our processor utilization 

Protection: Each process should only access its allocated memory 
    - each process should be protected against unwanted interference by other processes, whether accidental or intentional
    - done by using a pair of base and limit registers -> 

CPU will constanly check to make sure an address genereated between the base and limit registers
