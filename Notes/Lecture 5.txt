Lecture 5 - Uniprocessor Scheduling

Types of Scheduling
--

Four types:
    - long-term scheduling - decision to add to the pool of processes to be executed (gang/load sharing)

    - medium-term scheduling - decision to add the number of processes that are partically or fully in main memory (virtual memory)
    
    - ***short term scheduling - decision as to which avaliable process will executed by the processor (UNIPROCESSOR)

    - I/O scheduling - decision as to which processes pending I/O request shall be handled by an abaliable I/O device

Scheduling Criteria
--

user oriented - performance related 
    - turnaround time (TAT) - total time from when a process is submitted to when its completed, including both execution time and waitin time for
    resource 

    - response time - the duration from the submission of requests to beginning of the response in an interactive process 

    - deadlines - when process completion deadline can be set, the main focus of scheduling should be to maximize the percentage of these
    deadlines that met 

user oriented - other 
    - predictability - time and csot, should remain consistent regardless of system load 

system oriented - performance related 
--

- throughput - the number of processes completed per unit of time 

- processor ultilization - the percentage of time the processor is actively busy 
    - high processor utilization is particularly important expensive shared system as a measure of efficiency
    - for single-user systems and certain specialized systems may be less crucial compared to the other factors 

system oriented - other
--
    - fairness - all processes should be treated equally to prevent any process from experiencing starvation 
    - enforcing priorities - scheduling policy should prioritize processes based on their assigned importance (give those with higher
    priorities precedence)
    - balancing resources - scheduling strategy should aim to keep all system resources optimally busy

long-term scheduler
--
    - decides which program to admit for processing
    - manages the level of multiprogramming (simulatenous program execution)
        - increasing the number of processes reducess the proportion of time each one runes 
        - can restrict process admission to ensure equality service for ongoing processes 

    - process decisions:
        - processes are selected from a queue based on some specific criteria 
            - consider whether the operating system can handle an additional process

    - chooses jobs based on their arrival order, priority, expected runtime, and I/O needs

medium term
--
    - scheduling is part of a swapping function 
    - the swapping-in decisions is based on the need to manage the degree of multiprogramming 
    - in system without virtual memory, memory management is crucial; swapping-decisions depends on the memory needs of previously
    swapped-out process 

short-term scheduling 
--
    - acts as the dispatcher 
    - operates most frequently 
    - decides which process to run next based on fine-grained criteria 
    - activated by specific events like:
        - I/O interrupts 
        - clock interrupts
        - signals (e.g., semphore)
        - operating system calls 

process behavior
--
    - nearly all processes alternate with burst of compute with I/O requests (disk or network)
        - when the system call completes, the cpu computes again until it needs more data, or other requests. some I/O activites can count 
        as computing 

        - duration of CPU bursts varies from process to process, and from computer to computer system 
        - as the duration increases, frequency of these longer processes decreases
            - there are fewer processes that requires long periods of uninterrupted CPU time 

CPU scheduler 
--
- selects from a ready and allocates a process to a CPU core 
    - queue may be ordered in different ways 

- decisions take place when a process:
    - switches from running to wait state (no choice in terms of scheduling)
    - switches from running to ready (there is a choice)
    - switch from waiting to ready (there is a choice)
    - terminates (no choice in terms of scheduling)

selection function 
--
    - determines which process, among the ready processes, to be selected for next execution 
    - function can be based on priority, resource requirements, or the execution characteristics of the process 
    - execution characteristics:
        - w =  time spent in system so far, waiting 
        - e = time spend executing so far
        - s = total service time required by the process, including e; usually estimated or supplied by the user 

preemptive and nonpreemtive
--
    - preemptive - the process is changing to an interrupt state and has the notion it will resume again 

    - nonpreemtive - once the CPU has been allocated to a process, the process keeps executing until release (completion)
        1 - by the switching to a wait state 
        4 - by terminating 

preemptive scheduling and race conditions
--
    - preemptive can result in race conditions 
    - happens a lot when processes want to read/write same data (almost at the same time)

role of dispatcher
--
    - gives control of the CPU to the process selected by the CPU scheduler, which involves:
        - switch context 
        - switching to user mode 
        - jumping to the proper location in the user program to restart that program 
    
    - dispatch latency - time it takes for the dispatcher to stop one process and start another one

scheduling algorithm goals
--
    all systems:
        fairness - give each process a fair share of the CPU 
        policy enforcement - seeing that the stated policy is carried out 
        balance - keeping all parts of the system busy 

    batch systems:
        throughput - maximize jobs per hour 
        turnaround time (TAT) - minimize time between submission and termination 
        CPU utilization - keeping cpu busy at all times 

    interactive systems:
        response time - respond to requests quickly
        proportionality - meet users' expectations 

    real-time systemL
        meet deadlines - avoid losing data 
        predicatbility - avoid quality degradation in multimedia systems 

scheduling metrics 
--
    - cpu ulitzation - keeping the CPU as busy as possible 
    - throughput - # of processes that complete their execution per time unti (TU)
    - turnaround time (TAT) - amount of time to execute a particular process 
    - waiting time (WT) - amount of time a process waiting in the ready queue 
    - response time - amount of time it takes when a request was submitted until the response is produced

first-come, first-served (FCFS) scheduling - nonpreemptive

process | burst time (TU) | arrival time

p1        24.0              0.0
p2        3.0               0.0
p3        3.0               0.0


TAT = (completion-arrival)
wait time = (completion - arrival - burst)

arrival time : summation(TAT-burst)/# of processes

Shortest-Job-First (SJF)
--
    - convoy effect (FCFS): short process behind long process (considered CPU bound and many I/O-bound processes)

    SJF is considered pretty optimal
        - gives minimum average wait time from a given set of processes 

Preemptive version SJF is called shortest-remaining-time-first (SRT/SRTF)

SJF example:

process | burst time (TU) | arrival time 

p1        6.0               0.0
p2        8.0               2.0
p3        7.0               4.0
p4        3.0               5.0

Shortest-remaining-time-first (SRT, preemptive SJF)
- when a smaller (in terms of burst time) comes into queue, current job will be paused if that smaller is smaller than current running 

Determining length of Next CPU burst 
--
- can be done by using the length of previous CPU bursts, using exponential averaging 

1. tn = actual length of nth CPU burst 
2. tn+1 = predicted value for next CPU burst 
3. alpha: 0 <= alpha <= 1
4. define: Tn+1 = alpha * tn + (1 - alpha) * Tn

T = predicted 
t = actual 

Commonly, alpha set to 1/2 = 0.5

Example:
Calculate the exponential average with T1 = 10 (predicted), alpha = 0.5 and using SJF with previous runs, 6,7,4,__?___, what is T4?

Initally T1=10 and alpha = 0.5 and the runtimes given are 8,7,4.
- possible ordering because of SJF: 4,7,8 refers to t1,t2,t3 

T2 = alpha * t1 + (1-alpha) * t1 
    = 0.5  * 4  + (1-0.5)   * 10
    = 7

Round Robin (RR) -> preemptive 
--
- each process is assigned a fixed time slice, called time quantum (q) 
=> 10-100 milliseconds 

- after is time expires, the process is paused and moved to the end of the queue 
- each process recieves CPU time in chunks of up to q time units 
- the maximum wait time for any process is (n-1)*q time units 
- a timer interrupt is triggered at every quantum to switch to next process in queue 
- performance impacts:
    - if q is larger, the behavior resembles FCFS scheduling algorithm
    - if q is smaller, it must still be significantly larger than the context switch time to avoid excessive overhead 

Process     Burst time
P1          24.0
P2          3.0
P3          3.0 

arrival time  = 0
q = 4

Time Quantum and Context Switch Time 
--
performance of round robin depends on the value of the quantum:
    - if q is larger, same as FCFS 
    - if q if smaller, ends up with a lot of context switches 

Priority scheduling -> non preemptive 
- a priority number is given to each process 
- CPU is allocated to the process with highest priority 
- default: smallest integer is equivalent to the highest priority 
    - we can think SJF is priority scheduling where the priority is the predicted next CPU burst time 
- problem is equivalent to starvation -> low priority processes may never execute 
- solution is aging, as time progresses increase the priority of the process 

priority scheduling w/ round robin 
--
- run the process with highest priority, after ordering -> FCFS 
- processes with the same priority -> run in round robin (similar processes run in a preemptive nature)

multilevel queue
--
- with priority, have seperate queues for each priority 
- schedule the process in the higest priority queue
