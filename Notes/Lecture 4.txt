Lecture #4 - Multiprocessor, Multicore scheduling 

Classifications of Multiprocessor system:

    - Loosely coupled or distrubuted, or cluster. Consists of a collection of relatively autonomous, each processor having its own
    main memory and I/O channels

    - Functionally specialized processors: An example is an I/O processor. More specific to only handling I/O functions (services)

    - Tightly coupled multiprocessor: Consists of a set of processors that share a common main memory and are under the intergrated
    control of an operating system 

Synchronization Granularity and Process 
-- 

Grain sizes (intervals = instruction):
    fine - parallelism inherit a single intruction stream (intervals: <20)

    medium - parallel processing or multitasking in a single application (intervals: 20-200)

    coarse - multiprocessing of concurrent processes in multiprogrammed environment (intervals: 200-2000)

    independent - multiple unrelated processes (intervals: not applicable)
